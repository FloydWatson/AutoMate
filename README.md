AutoMate is an App to calculate your carbon footprint and to encourage alternate transport options. It ultimately aims to reduce this to help combat climate change by reducing pollution, reduce traffic congestion in the CBD and motivate the use of public transportation, which is currently severley underutelised.

# Problem

Nationwide Our travel habits are straining current infrastructure. Congestion alongside a underutilised public transport system is  pushing CBD's to there limits.
Auckland is now the 47th worst city in the world in terms of traffic congestion. 
This causes a number of unforeseen issues.
Firstly,
The economic cost of congestion is between $1 billion to $1.3 billion annually.
Secondly,
Road vehicle emissions were up 82.1 percent from 1990, and made up 39.1 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2016
And thirdly,
It has detrimental effects on the populous as a whole. Such as  increased respiratory problems in a community due to poor air quality and increased stress levels for the public stuck in traffic.

# Solution
At AutoMate we are taking a new angle on helping to solve these issues and bring us all a cleaner, smoother, less stressful future. We aim to change the public mindset and bring a more accessible way for us all to do our own part. To achieve this we are creating an application that analyzes public transport data from new zealand largest city, Auckland. 
AutoMate is going to bring public transport infrastructure into the technical age, and break down the barriers of inaccessibility.  Users will have the ability to dynamically access all options for their travel needs, as well as all the details needed that currently are not easily accessible to the public, to truly create the public transport of the future. Users will be able to track the financial and environmental impact they are having by seeing how much petrol they save and how their carbon footprint is affected. 
Alongside the public transport angle AutoMate plans to break the stigma around carpooling/ ride sharing. Currently carpooling is seen as an inconvenience or unreliable, these blemishes on its reputation has lead to a fall in popularity over the years. In order to effectively combat these AutoMate plans to provide users with methods to easily and reliably bring riders and drivers together. Weather going near or far, our navigational algorithms will take the most effective routes and seamlessly match users with minimal inconvenience. 
We at AutoMate care about our users and the future of our planet, we plan to bring the gold standard of travel technology to the fingertips of all users, so that we can each do our part for a brighter future together.
congestion in Auckland is now well above that of comparable cities and is increasing exponentially. The study reveals that the economic cost of congestion is between $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion
The report found if Auckland traffic could move on average between 50.5 kmh to 56.8 kmh during week days it would benefit the Auckland economy by nearly $3.5 million per day. At the moment the average speed in the morning peak is 41 kmh. 
Road vehicle emissions were up 82.1 percent from 1990, and made up 39.1 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2016
The more greenhouse gases produced, the faster the world's climate heats up.
