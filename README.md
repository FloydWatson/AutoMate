# Problem
Traffic congestion is increasing <br>
People under utilizing space in their vehicles <br>
Underutilized public transport <br>
Underutilized cycle lanes <br>


# Solution
Create an application that allows users to better utilize the current infrastructure. <br>
This will be obtained through a system designed to increase car pooling and inform people about other available forms of transportation. The application consists of a car pooling "request ride" and "provide ride" section which handles the transactional part, and a public transport section. Both are displayed on a map with which the user can interact. The app also keeps track of the users carbon footprint, and the benefits of having used the app. <br>
The future of the app includes providing a broader range of public transport methods including bike tracks and walking paths. <br>
